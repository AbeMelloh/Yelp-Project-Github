MSBA Semester 1 Yelp Project-Data Analysis in R

Explored what attributes of a restraunt, such as having a coat check, accepting credit cards, having outdoor seating, etc
affected yelp review rating.

Used various statistical methods to verify which attributes mattered, which ones didn't, and which ones were confounding each other.
